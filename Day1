# Introduction
# Day 1 - 30DaysOfPython Challenge
#What is Python?
#Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
#Python is a general-purpose, dynamically typed, high-level, compiled and interpreted,
#garbage-collected, and purely object-oriented programming language that supports procedural, 
#object-oriented, and functional programming.

#Features of Python:
#Open Source 
#Rich Standard Library 
#Cross-platform Compatibility
#Purely Object-Oriented
#Garbage Collected
#Compiled and Interpreted 
#High-level 
#Dynamically Typed
#Easy to use and Read

#What is Python syntax?

#The syntax of the Python programming language is the set of rules that defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted


#What is variable?
#Python variables are simply containers for storing data values. 

#What is python comments?
#Comments can be used to explain Python code.


#In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType


print("Hello,World")
print(3 + 2)   # addition(+)
print(3 - 2)   # subtraction(-)
print(3 * 2)   # multiplication(*)
print(3 / 2)   # division(/)
print(3 ** 2)  # exponential(**)
print(3 % 2)   # modulus(%)
print(3 // 2)  # Floor division operator(//)

# Checking data types

print(type(10))                  # Int
print(type(3.14))                # Float
print(type(1 + 3j))              # Complex
print(type('Asabeneh'))          # String
print(type([1, 2, 3]))           # List
print(type({'name':'Asabeneh'})) # Dictionary
print(type({9.8, 3.14, 2.7}))    # Set
print(type((9.8, 3.14, 2.7)))    # Tuple
print(type(3 == 3))              # Bool
print(type(3 >= 3))              # Bool
